This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cassandra's ReactJS Templates (UmbrellaJS - because it keeps you DRY)

This repo is a group of unconnected components with a Create React App infrastructure wrapped around them so I can test and style them easily.

## Background

There are a lot of libraries out there to make forms easier or do basic things, but I prefer not introducing dependencies into my projects if I can help it.  So I'm going to just build a goto set of ReactJS component templates, give them pretty styles, and have them for future reference to make building
basic common attributes of single page apps much quicker.

## Current Templates
- Splash Page

## Future Templates
- Nav Bar
- Login Form
- Basic Text Form
- Dropdown Component
- Checkbox Component
- Radio Button Component
- Button Component
- Hamburger Menu
- Carousel Component
- Progress Bar
- Clock
- Timer
- Clicker w/ Counter
- Upload Form
- Download Page
- Index (tall)
- Index (wide)
- Index Item (read only)
- Index Item (line item edit)
- More to be determined

## Installation

Clone the repo, run ```npm install```, and ```npm start``` to see the templates on localhost.

## Usage
I dunno, if you really like my components and styles, please credit me?  Will put more specific details for each template as I make them
